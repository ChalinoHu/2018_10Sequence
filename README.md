In order to solve the problem of long-distance wire disorder, the sender and data terminal equipment are set up. The sender equipment encodes and sends data information through stm32f03 MCU, and forwards it through power carrier machine. After receiving the information, the receiver equipment verifies the information by MCU and decodes it to find the corresponding order of cables.
